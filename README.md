# Chezburgr's Location Manager

Chezburgr's Location Manager is a plugin I built a long time ago for the Craftbukkit implementation of Minecraft. Although I never quite finished it, the intent of the plugin was to provide a comprehensive system for tracking the locations of all the players in the game, so that managing players could be easier. Its primary purpose was that if an admin or owner of the server needed the location of the player, but that location was not readily available at that time, the plugin would be able to provide the last known location of the player, which would also be the start location of that player the next time they logged on to the server. Under the default Craftbukkit system, only currently online players had accessible location information, and only a few details for offline players could be retrieved.

It is unlikely that this software will ever be maintained again, but if you have a way to improve it, feel free to submit a pull request.
